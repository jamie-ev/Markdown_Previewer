# Markdown Previewer
Built using React.js and Marked.js

## Description

I built this markdown previewer to help me deepen my understanding of React.js and to practice pulling from the Marked.js library and updating an app based on user input. The HTML is very minimal as my React code, housed in the .js file, does all the heavy lifting of rendering HTML from JSX. The React code contains a parent component that feeds inputted text as props to a child component.

## Getting Started

You can find my original files in /dev_files/app, and the root files are copied over from /dev_files/build. I commented fairly extensively throughout the files, but please let me know if you have any questions. To view this project live on GitHub Pages, please visit [this link](https://jamie-ev.github.io/Markdown_Previewer/). Thanks for dropping by!

# Depencies

* React
* ReactDOM
* Marked
* Babel
* Webpack

(The last two are used to convert the JSX and ES6 from the React code.)
